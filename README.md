<h2 align="center">🧠 About Me</h2>

I'm passionate about solving complex financial problems with data-driven tools and intelligent systems. My work bridges the gap between finance and technology — from automating accounts payable processes with Power Automate Desktop to simulating market risk in Python using Monte Carlo methods.

I enjoy building things that make workflows smarter, decisions clearer, and insights faster.

<h2 align="center">⚙️ Current Projects</h2>

- **Crypto Portfolio Optimization Tool**  
  Streamlit app using Modern Portfolio Theory and real-time crypto data (CoinGecko/YFinance), integrated with SQLite for persistent storage. Includes optimization modes (Max Sharpe, Min Volatility), historical returns visualization, and fallback logic for data retrieval.

- **Automated Invoice Classifier (PAD)**  
  Power Automate Desktop workflow that classifies, routes, and organizes email attachments into invoice/statement directories. Uses keyword logic to distinguish multi-type documents and avoid duplicates.
  
- **Crude Oil Risk Simulator (Monte Carlo)**  
  10,000-path Monte Carlo simulation of crude oil stock prices (e.g., XOM), modeling VaR/CVaR with historical overlays, dark mode UI, and CSV output formatting. Built with Python, R, and Streamlit; data pulled via YFinance and stored in SQLite.
